      <h1>Encounter</h1>

      <p>Nightfall draped Pandora's forests in shadows alive with threat. With my bow drawn, I edged along the moss-cloaked branches, every sense taut for movement.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, my eyes locked onto a flicker of movement—unnatural, out of rhythm with the forest. Just under the trees, a dreamwalker body moved through the undergrowth, with a torch in his hand. </p>
      <p>An intruder, I thought. A true Na'vi is connected to everything in Pandora, and they don't even need a torch to light up their roads. But the Sky People do, once upon a time I peeped through the leaves, the dazzling white light from the stronghold of Sky People afar tore the sky apart. I could heard the forest wailing. The memory alone made my teeth itch. </p>
      <p>I shook my head, inhaling the damp night air to clear the memory. The scent of night-blooming helicoradian petals clung to the humid air, steadying my breath. However, the forest at night was a forbidden area for the Sky People to step in. So, why was he here?</p>
      <p>The bowstring trembled against my cheek - one breath, one release, and the dreamwalker's throat would bloom red. Then came the light. Not the harsh white glare of his torch, but a soft blue radiance that danced along my arrowhead. A woodsprite. Its delicate tendrils brushed my skin, carrying whispers that echoed with ancient rhythms. With hesitation in mind, I still sheathed my bow.</p>
      <p>The night swallowed the forest whole. Without warning, viperwolves melted from the shadows—six, maybe more. Their lean bodies coiled, then sprang. The dreamwalker swung his torch like a club, its flame hissing as it grazed a muzzle. The pack scattered, only to regroup instantly, lips peeled back over needle-fangs. This time, they came for his throat. He wouldn't last another minute, I realized.</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, I loosed an arrow. It found its mark with a wet thunk, dropping the lead viperwolf mid-leap. In one fluid motion, I drew, aimed, and released. The viperwolf crumpled, its snarl cut short. After they were dispelled, I jumped down from the branches, kneeling, praying to Eywa for my slaughters.</p>
      <p>The dreamwalker stammered his thanks, so clumsily and comically. I ignored him and rose to my feet. He came to me and held my wrist - too warm, too human. I wrenched back with a hiss that bared my teeth. Looking into his light-yellow eyes, strangely I found there was no fear. It was a mixed, complex impression I could not understand. </p>
      <p>I turned back, heading to the village. The dreamwalker followed. I roared: "Leave!" </p>
      <p>He lowered his head like a child who had done something wrong. "I just wanted to thank you. If it weren't you…” He murmured.</p>
      <p>I interrupted him coldly: "Don't thank. You don't thank for this. This is sad. Very sad only. All this is your fault. They did not need to die.” It seemed that he wanted to say something else, but I wouldn't like to listen to. The Sky People never knew what they had done. </p>
      <p>Just then, a woodsprite spiraled down and stopped on his hand. He hit it away, but I stopped him. Then, dozens, hundreds of woodsprites descended like living stars. They clung to his arms, his shoulders, even the sweat-damp strands of his hair. Never had I seen the sacred seeds embrace a Sky Person. It was a miracle. I held his hand. His palm was slick with sweat, clammy against my skin. "Come," I said, and this time, the command was for him, as much as myself.</p>
