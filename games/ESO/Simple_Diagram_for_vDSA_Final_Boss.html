      <h1>Simple Diagram for vDSA Final Boss</h1>
      <p>Dragonstar Arena is not difficult, but it is very long. Therefore, a team composed of one tank and three damage dealers (DDs) is usually more efficient and time-saving for farming. Here is a simple diagram to explain how to defeat the final boss quickly and easily.</p>
      <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The total DPS should exceed 100k. One of the DDs can taunt the boss. Both the tank and one of the DDs should be able to provide a Barrier.</p>

      <p><strong>Area #1:</strong> The DDs should stay beside the gate before the boss arrives.</p>
      <p><strong>Area #2:</strong> The tank should stay here with the boss until the first Flame Atronach appears.</p>
      <p><strong>Area #3:</strong> The tank should stay here with the adds and prevent them from attacking the DDs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>At the beginning, the DDs should stay in Area #1, and the tank should go to Area #2 and wait for the boss. When the boss appears, the tank taunts him and stays in Area #2 until the first Flame Atronach emerges. Afterward, the tank moves to Area #1, and one of the DDs will taunt the boss.</p>
      <p>When the boss reaches 75% health, he will summon adds. The tank needs to taunt them and bring them to Area #3.</p>
      <p>When the boss reaches 50% health, he will pull all players toward him and then release a full-screen AoE attack. The tank needs to return to Area #1 before this happens, and the DD should provide a Barrier. After that, the tank should return to Area #3.</p>
      <p>When the boss reaches 25% health, the same thing will happen again, but this time the tank should provide the Barrier. Afterward, the tank returns to Area #3 again, and the DDs finish off the boss. Not hard, right? But there are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
      <p>1. The tank needs to stay in Area #2, not Area #3, before the first Flame Atronach appears to avoid the fire AoE.</p>
      <p>2. The tank does not need to provide any buffs—just focus on surviving and avoid dying.</p>
      <p>3. Reviving Barrier is better than Replenishing Barrier in this situation, as it is a HoT.</p>
      <p>4. When there is a healer in the group, they will be responsible for taunting the boss and providing the Barrier. Heal-over-time abilities are essential!</p>
